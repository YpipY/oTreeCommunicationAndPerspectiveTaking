# oTree Communication And Perspective-Taking Project
This project is using the oTree package: 
Chen, D. L., Schonger, M., & Wickens, C. (2016). oTreeâ€”An open-source platform for laboratory, online, and field experiments. Journal of Behavioral and Experimental Finance, 9, 88-97.

### To run on your own computer for testing do as follows
  - Make sure you have the newest version of oTree >= 5.1.9 and Python >= 3.7, older then that and I cannot guarantee the code will run. 
    oTree install instrutions can be found here: https://otree.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html 
    Python can be found here: https://www.python.org/downloads/
  - Save the GitHub repository to a folder of your choice
  - Open the command prompt and go to the directory you save the repository in (eg. cd C:\Users\[Insert Username]\oTreeCommunicationAndPerspectiveTaking)) 
  - Type in the command prompt: otree devserver 
  - Open your web browser and go to http://localhost:8000/

Then you should see the example games and test them out for yourself
